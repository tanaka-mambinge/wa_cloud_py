## Getting started

### Installation

To install the library, run the following command:

```console
pip install wa_cloud_py
```

### Creating WhatsApp instance

Before sending messages, you need to configure the access token and phone number id. You can find these values in your Meta Apps dashboard.

```python
from wa_cloud_py import WhatsApp

whatsapp = WhatsApp(access_token="WHATSAPP_ACCESS_TOKEN", phone_number_id="WHATSAPP_PHONE_NUMBER_ID")
```

## Sending messages

### Send text message

To send a basic text message, use the `send_text` method. You'll need to provide the recipient's phone number and the text message.

```python
whatsapp.send_text(to="phone_number", text="Hello world!")
```

### Send text message with context (replying to a message)

![Replying to a message](assets/images/reply.png)

   ],
)
```

## Processing incoming messages

NB: The following examples are using [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com)

When a user sends a message to your WhatsApp number, you'll receive a post request to your webhook. To process the message, use the `parse` method. You'll need to provide the request data.

```python
from wa_cloud_py import WhatsApp
from wa_cloud_py.message_types import MessageStatus, UserMessage
from flask import request
from flask.views import MethodView


class GroupAPI(MethodView):
    init_every_request = False

    def get(self):
        #verify token
        pass

    def post(self):
        whatsapp = WhatsApp(access_token="access_token", phone_number_id="phone_number_id")
        message = whatsapp.parse(request.data)

        # check if a the message was sent by a user
        if isinstance(message, UserMessage):

            # process text message
            if isinstance(message, TextMessage):
               message_sent, res = whatsapp.send_text(
                   to=message.user.phone_number,
                   body="Hello World",
               )

            # process order
            if isinstance(message, OrderMessage):
                pass

        # print status of message you sent to the user
        elif isinstance(message, MessageStatus):
            print(message)

        # handle unsupported message types
        else:
            print("Unsupported message type")

        return "", 200


wa_webhook = GroupAPI.as_view(f"WaWebhook")
```

### User messages vs Message status

User messages are messages sent by a user. Message status are messages sent by the WhatsApp Cloud API to confirm the status of a message you sent to a user. All user messages inherit from the `UserMessage` class.

The following user message classes inherit from the `UserMessage` class:

- [`TextMessage`](#text-messages) - A text only message sent by the user to your WhatsApp number.
- [`InteractiveMessage`](#interactive-messages) - A message sent by the user when they click on an interactive button or list item.
- [`OrderMessage`](#order-messages) - A message sent by the user when they place an order using the WhatsApp cart.
- `ImageMessage` - A message sent by the user when they send an image.
- `AudioMessage` - A message sent by the user when they send an audio file.
- `DocumentMessage` - A message sent by the user when they send a document.

### User object

All incoming user messages have a `user` property. The user object contains the following properties:

- `name: str` - The user's name on WhatsApp
- `phone_number: str` = The user's phone number. Useful when you want to reply to the user's message.

### Text messages

```python
#process text message
if isinstance(message, TextMessage):
    pass
```

When the user sends a text message, you'll receive a `TextMessage` object. If the message type is `MessageType.TEXT`, you can access the following properties:

- `id: str` - The message id e.g. `wamid.abc123`
- `user: User` - The [user object](#user-object)
- `context_message_id: str` - The message id of the message the user replied to e.g. `wamid.abc123`
- `timestamp: str` - The time the message was sent by the user e.g. `1696669497`
- `type: str` - The message type e.g. `text`
- `body: str` - The message body e.g. `Hello there!`

### Order messages

```python
#process order
if isinstance(message, OrderMessage):
    pass
```

Users can use the WhatsApp cart to place orders. If the message type is `MessageType.ORDER`, you can access thefollowing properties:

- `id: str` - The message id e.g. `wamid.abc123`
- `user: User` - The [user object](#user-object)
- `timestamp: str` - The time the message was sent by the user e.g. `1696669497`
- `type: str` - The message type e.g. `order`
- `catalog_id: str` - The ID of the catalog the user ordered from e.g. `123`
- `products: List[Product]` - A list of products the user ordered. Each product has the following properties:
  - `id: str` - The product id e.g. `product_id_1`
  - `quantity: int` - The quantity of the product ordered e.g. `2`
  - `price: float` - The price of the product at the time it was ordered e.g. `10.99`
  - `currency: str` - The currency of the product price e.g. `ZWL`

### Interactive messages

```python
#process message based on reply_id
if isinstance(message, InteractiveMessage):
    pass
```

When a user clicks on an interactive button or list item, you'll receive an interactive message. If the message type is `MessageType.INTERACTIVE`, you can access thefollowing properties:

- `id: str` - The message id e.g. `wamid.abc123`
- `user: User` - The [user object](#user-object)
- `context_message_id: str` - The message id of the message the user replied to. In this case it's the interactive message. Message id e.g. `wamid.abc123`
- `timestamp: str` - The time the message was sent by the user e.g. `1696669497`
- `type: str` - The message type e.g. `interactive`
- `reply_id: str` - The id of the button or list item the user clicked e.g. `pay_with_ecocash`
- `title: str` - The title of the button or list item the user clicked e.g. EcoCash
- `description: str` - The description of the list item the user clicked e.g. Phone number required

### Message status

When you send a message to a user, you'll receive 2 api calls from the WhatsApp Cloud API. The first call is to confirm that the message was sent to the user. The second call is to confirm that the message was delivered to the user.

The `MessageStatus` class contains the following properties:

- `id: str` - The id of the message you sent to the user e.g. `wamid.abc123`
- `status: str` - The status of the message. Can be one of the following values:
  - `sent` - The message was sent to the user (single tick)
  - `delivered` - The message was delivered to the user (double tick)
- `timestamp: str` - The time the message was sent to the user e.g. `1696669497`
- `recipient_phone: str` - The phone number of the user the message was sent to e.g. `263712345678`
- `billable: bool` - Whether the message was billable or not e.g. `True`
- `pricing_model: bool` - The pricing model used to bill the message e.g. `CBP` (Conversation Based Pricing)
- `message_category: str` - The message category used for billing. Can be one of the following values:
  - `service` - The message was sent for service purposes
  - `marketing` - The message was sent for marketing purposes
  - `utility` - The message was sent for utility purposes
  - `auth` - The message was sent for authentication purposes

## Update business profile
